<h1>Applying the basics.</h1>
<p>In the previous article we discussed the basic building blocks of Spring Security:<br>
- The Spring Security dependency.<br>
- A configuration class annotated with <code>@Configuration</code> and <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code>.<br>
- A <code>SecurityFilterChain</code>.<br>
- A <code>UserDetailsService</code>.<br>
- A <code>PasswordEncoder</code>.</p>
<p>In this article we are going to get hands on and use these building blocks to secure an application.</p>
<p>So, let's start and create our webapplication. Surf to the Spring Initializr page at: 
<a href="https://start.spring.io/">https://start.spring.io/</a> and use the initializer to create a Spring project.
I opted for Java and Maven, but you can pick whatever you prefer. The only dependency we are going to add is the Spring Web 
dependency. This is the only dependency we need to be able to create a webapplication.</p></div>

<div class="article-container">
<p>Save the zip-file, extract it to a folder of your choosing and import the project into your IDE of choice.</p>
<p>Now let's create a controller class in our application. I created a new package named "controller" in the main package of 
the application. And inside this controller package I created a new class with the name <code>UserController</code> but you
can name it whatever you like.</p>
</div>
<img src="img/add controller.jpg" alt="Screenshot of project structure">
<div class="article-container">
<p>Give the class the annotation <code>@RestController</code> and create 3 endpoints 
like I have done in the code example. Since we haven't added security to our application, these 3 endpoints are 
accessible to anyone. Don't worry, we will secure them soon. This is the code of the class:</p>
<pre><code>
package com.spring.basics.SpringBasics.controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class UserController {
	
	@GetMapping("/no-security")
	public String openToAll() {
		return "Welcome to all";
	}
	
	@GetMapping("/some-security")
	public String openToSome() {
		return "Welcome to some";
	}
	
	@GetMapping("/full-security")
	public String openToOne() {
		return "Welcome to only one";
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Spring Initializer has created an application class for you. Since I named my project <code>SpringBasics</code>, the application class generated for me
is called <code>SpringBasicsApplication</code>. Yours can have a different name. Find your application class and run it to start your Spring application.</p>
<p>Your webapplication also comes with an embedded web server that is started when you start the application. This web server will run your application on the default 
address <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. With your application running open your webbrowser and surf to the first endpoint we have created at the URL 
<code>http://localhost:8080/no-security</code>. You should see a screen like this:</p></div>
<img src="img/endpoint no security.jpg" alt="Screenshot of no security endpoint">
<div class="article-container">
<p>Our application has allowed access to the <code>/no-security</code> endpoint as indicated by the fact that we can open this page and we can see the "Welcome to all"
message. You can surf to the other two endpoints if you like and verify that they are also accessible. Just change the URL to match the other endpoints by replacing the
"/no-security"-part of the URL by "/some-security" or "/full-security".</p>
<p>So, let's look at our current situation. We have a web application running on the embedded server. This application has 3 endpoints that are accessible by anyone,
even unauthenticated users. We have zero security at the moment. Let's change that.</p>
<p>Let's add the Spring Security dependency to our application. This is the first and most important building block of Spring Security. In a Maven project, which is what I
use, this is done by adding the following code the to pom.xml file:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;dependency&gt;
     &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
     &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>Now that we have added the security dependency, stop your application. In Eclipse you can do that by pressing the stop button in the console window:</p></div>
<img src="img/eclipse stop button.jpg" alt="Screenshot of eclipse stop button">
<div class="article-container">
<p>Now start the application again and try to go to one of the 3 endpoints we have created. For instance type <code>http://localhost:8080/no-security</code> 
in the address balk of your web browser, press enter and you should now see a screen like this:</p></div>
<img src="img/login screen.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the login screen">
<div class="article-container">
<p>What has happened? I tried to visit <code>http://localhost:8080/no-security</code> and now I see a login page at <code>http://localhost:8080/login</code>?<br> 
By adding the security dependency we have enabled Spring Security. And when security is enabled, Spring will restrict access to all endpoints for unauthenticated users. 
Anytime an unauthenticated user tries to visit our endpoints they are being redirected to the default login page at <code>/login</code>.
<p>Restricting access for unauthenticated users and redirecting them to a HTML page that includes a login form at <code>/login</code> are all default behaviours that come
with Spring Security. And there is more. For instance try using the login form while leaving the username or password field empty. Spring will show you a message 
asking you to fill out those fields. This is Spring giving you form validation out of the box. And if you try to login with a username and a password that do not exist, 
Spring will redirect you to an empty login form and show you the error message 'Bad credentials'.</p>
<p>All these default security behaviours are very nice, but we had a working web application with functioning endpoints and now none of that is working anymore. It's our
application and even we are locked out of it!<br>
But don't worry, Spring has you covered. Each time we start our application Spring creates a default user with
credentials we can use to log into the application. This default username is 'user' and the default password is being displayed in the console at startup:</p>
</div>
<img src="img/default user.jpg" alt="Screenshot of default credentials">
<div class="article-container">
<p>Note that the password that is being shown to you in the console is an encoded password. By default Spring uses the BCrypt algorithm for this encoding.</p> 
<p>Copy the password that is displayed in your console and go ahead and login by using 'user' as the username and that copied password. Spring should log you in and 
redirect you to the page you were trying to visit. So, if you were unauthenticated and tried to visit <code>http://localhost:8080/some-security</code>, Spring will 
redirect you to the login page and upon succesfull authentication show you this <code>http://localhost:8080/some-security</code> endpoint. If you tried 
to visit <code>http://localhost:8080/no-security</code>, then that's the page that will be shown to you when you login successfully.</p>
<p>We have enabled security and we have a default user, but that's still not very useful. We want an application that can be used by more than one user. So let's 
start configuring our application and make it more practical. To achieve that we are going to create a configuration class.<br> I placed a new package inside the 
main package of the application, called it "config" and created a class named ProjectConfig inside of it. Of course you can structure your application differently.</p>
</div>
<img src="img/add config.jpg" alt="Screenshot of project with config class">
<div class="article-container">
<p>As explained it the previous article, we are going to give this class the <code>@Configuration</code> and <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code> annotations. It's inside 
this class that we are going to be handling most of the security aspects of our application.</p>
<p>To handle authorization, we are going to need a <code>SecurityFilterChain</code>. Remember that once we are adding a <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> to our application, 
Spring assumes that we are handling authorization ourselves. This means that Spring will no longer present users with a login form or handle the security of our endpoints
for us. All that will become our responsibility.<br>
The same thing happens with authorization. Once Spring notices that we are handling authorization ourselves, for instance because we have declared a 
<code>UserDetailsService</code> bean, it will no longer provide us we a default user and password.</p>
<p>Let's add a <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> in our <code>ProjectConfig</code> class</p>
</div>
<img src="img/filterChain1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of filterChain">
<div class="article-container">
<p>By adding this <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> we have locked all our endpoints except the <code>/no-security</code> endpoint that is open
to all. Users will be able to visit the <code>/no-security</code> endpoint, but when they try to go to one of our other endpoints, they will see the following 403 error 
message:</p>
</div>
<img src="img/403 error.jpg" alt="Screenshot of 403 error message">
<div class="article-container">
<p>Like we mentioned, Spring no longer presents our users with the default login form when they are unauthenticated and trying to use a protected endpoint. We have to 
handle this ourselves. So let's add form login capabilities to our application. Adjust the <code>SecurityFilterChain</code>:</p>
</div>
<img src="img/filterChain2.jpg" alt="Screenshot of SecurityFilterChain">
<div class="article-container">
<p>Adding <code>.formLogin()</code> to our <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> is functionally the same as adding <code>.formLogin(Customizer.withDefaults())</code> to it. 
Both enable form-based authentication with default settings, <code>.formLogin()</code> is a shorthand method that internally calls <code>.formLogin(Customizer.withDefaults())</code>.</p>
<p>We've added the security dependency, we have created a configuration class and inside that class we have defined our <code>SecurityFilterChain</code>. That means we 
have already got our hands dirty with three of the basic building blocks of Spring Security. Let's add a fourth. Let's define some users, so we can experiment with 
roles and authorities. This means providing Spring with a <code>UserDetailsService</code> so it can handle authentication and authorization.</p>
<p>Roles and authorities are often used interchangeably. But they are not the same thing. In Spring Security roles are a high-level grouping of permissions. While 
authorities are a specific permission. An administrator for instance could have the role 'ADMIN', which could group the authorities read, write, delete and update. While 
a regular user could have role 'USER' and for instance only the authorities read and write. Defining the roles and deciding which authorities are grouped in a role, is up 
to us.</p>
<p>As an example I have created three users. The one with the least access is the visitor, who has been given the role 'RED'. The next user is one we want to give more access 
in our application. He has been given the roles 'ORANGE' and the username 'user'. And the final user, who we have given the name 'admin', will get the most access and 
receives the role 'GREEN'. I have created a <code>UserDetailsService</code> bean, so Spring has access to a repository of these users that it can utilize when it 
needs to verify credentials or authorization. Here is the code I used:</p>
</div>
<img src="img/roles.jpg" alt="Screenshot of UserDetailsService">
<div class="article-container">
<p>So, in this case we have regulated the levels of access a users has in our application by giving them roles. I made no use of authorities. If you want to make use of 
both roles and authorities or not, depends on the level of fine grained control that you requier. For very complex applications it might be necessary to use them both. 
So you can handle what a user is allowed to do or access in more details by creating authorities. And then group these authorities together as roles, so you can assign 
them in one go to a user. But in our application with only three endpoints, using authorities would be a bit of overkill.</p>
<p>Let's rewrite our <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> so that it handles the different roles we have created. I want none of our endpoints to be accessible without 
authentication. The user with the least amount of access (role 'RED') should only be able to access our <code>/no-security</p> endpoint. The user with a bit more access 
(role 'ORANGE') should be able to access both <code>/no-security</p> and <code>/some-security</p>, but also be restricted from our <code>/full-security</code> endpoint. And 
the user with the most access, our 'admin' user, should have access to all three endpoints. This is the <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> after the rewrite:</p>
