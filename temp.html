<h1>Applying the basics.</h1>
<p>In the previous article we discussed the basic building blocks of Spring Security:<br>
- The Spring Security dependency (<code>spring-boot-starter-security</code> for Spring Boot applications).<br>
- A configuration class annotated with <code>@Configuration</code> and <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code>.<br>
- A <code>SecurityFilterChain</code>.<br>
- A <code>UserDetailsService</code>.<br>
- A <code>PasswordEncoder</code>.</p>
<p>In this article we are going to get hands on and use these building blocks to secure an application. So, let's start and create our webapplication.
Surf to the Spring Initializr page at: <a href="https://start.spring.io/">https://start.spring.io/</a> and use the initializer to create a Spring project.
I opted for Java and Maven, but you can pick whatever you prefer. The only dependency we are going to add is the Spring Web dependency. This is the only dependency we
need to be able to create a webapplication.<br>

Save the zip-file, extract it to a folder of your choosing and import the project into your IDE of choice.
