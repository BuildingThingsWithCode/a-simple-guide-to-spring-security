<p>Go more in depth and expand on the previous article. Subject matter:</p>
<p>AuthenticationManager is the interface that defines how Spring Security's Filters perform authentication.</p>
<p>ProviderManager is the most commonly used implementation of AuthenticationManager.</p>
<p>Both UserDetailsService and PasswordEncoder are fields in the Provider. So for instance the DaoAuthenticationProvider will have UserDetailsService and PasswordEncoder as fields.
Since the provider implements the AuthenticationManager, it has to overwrite the authenticate() method. Inside this method to provider will loop over all the providers that are given to
Spring in the application and will try to authenticate the user with each of the providers that it has access to.</p>
