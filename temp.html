<h1>Applying the basics.</h1>
<p>In the previous article we discussed the basic building blocks of Spring Security:<br>
- The Spring Security dependency.<br>
- A configuration class annotated with <code>@Configuration</code> and <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code>.<br>
- A <code>SecurityFilterChain</code>.<br>
- A <code>UserDetailsService</code>.<br>
- A <code>PasswordEncoder</code>.</p>
<p>In this article we are going to get hands on and use these building blocks to secure an application.</p>
<p>So, let's start and create our webapplication. Surf to the Spring Initializr page at: 
<a href="https://start.spring.io/">https://start.spring.io/</a> and use the initializer to create a Spring project.
I opted for Java and Maven, but you can pick whatever you prefer. The only dependency we are going to add is the Spring Web 
dependency. This is the only dependency we need to be able to create a webapplication.</p></div>

<p>Save the zip-file, extract it to a folder of your choosing and import the project into your IDE of choice.</p>
<p>Now let's create a controller class in our application. I called this class <code>UserController</code>but you
can name if whatever you like. Give the class the following annotation <code>RestController</code> and create 3 endpoints
in the class. Since we have not yet added security to our application, these 3 endpoints can be accessed by anyone for now.
But we are going to secure them a little later. This is the full code of my class:</p>
<code>
package com.spring.basics.SpringBasics.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class UserController {
	
	@GetMapping("/no-security")
	public String openToAll() {
		return "Welcome to all";
	}
	
	@GetMapping("/some-security")
	public String openToSome() {
		return "Welcome to some";
	}
	
	@GetMapping("/full-security")
	public String openToOne() {
		return "Welcome to only one";
	}

}
</code>
