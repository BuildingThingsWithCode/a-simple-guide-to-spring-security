<h3>Preface.</h3>
<p>When I first started learning Spring Security, I found plenty of in-depth resources and tutorials, but I struggled to follow along. The problem was that I lacked a clear
overview, a mental picture of how everything fit together. Without that foundation, all the detailed information felt overwhelming and disconnected. I was "not seeing the 
forest for the trees." Which isn't that surprising, Spring Security is huge when you really want to understand all its intricacies.</p>
<p>And I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person who’s experienced this. On r/SpringBoot, the largest Reddit community dedicated to the Spring framework, one of the most 
upvoted posts of all time is titled "I hate Spring Security." You can find it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpringBoot/comments/17imb9j/i_hate_spring_security/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
In the post, the author shared their frustration, saying:
<i>"I keep trying to love Spring Boot, but the security is so damn complex you forget where you are. Am I supposed to ‘memorize’ all these functions and then call myself 
	an ‘expert’ when I do?"</i>
<p>That is why, in this article, I'm taking a different approach. Instead of aiming to be a comprehensive guide covering every aspect of Spring Security, my goal is to teach
only the minimum you need to know to be able to effectively implement Spring Security, so that the information stays digestible and approachable.</p>
<p>If by the end of this article, you understand the basic building blocks of Spring Security and how they fit together, then I will consider this a success. Once you have 
that solid foundation, diving into the details becomes a lot easier.</p>
<p>This article is about a 20-minute read, so you probably don’t want to try reading this on a mobile device. Bookmark it and come back later.</p>
<h3>The Security Dependency.</h3>
<p>To add Spring Security to our application, all we need to do is add the security dependency to the application's dependencies. Since I'm using Maven and Spring Boot in 
my project, this means adding the following code to the pom.xml file:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;dependency&gt;
     &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
     &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>Adding the dependency does several things:</p>

<p><strong>1) It enables authentication.</strong> Once the security dependency is added, all endpoints in the application will require authentication. This means that endpoints, which were previously accessible without logging in, will now require valid credentials to be accessed. So, if you add the security dependency to a Spring Boot application and notice that things stop working as expected, don’t be alarmed—this is normal behavior. By adding security, you're restricting access to your endpoints, which were previously open to everyone.</p>

<p><strong>2) Spring will create a default user and a random password for this user.</strong> The username of this default user is 'user' and the password will be logged in the console when we start up our application. Each time we start our application, Spring will generate a different password and display it in the console. We can therefore still use our application after authentication has been enabled, but we need to login with the username 'user' and the password that is provided by Spring.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Spring stops giving you this default user when you start implementing your own custom security by creating a <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> bean or other custom security beans like <code>UserDetailsService</code>, <code>PasswordEncoder</code>, <code>AuthenticationManager</code>, etc. Don’t get distracted by the fact that I mention several security beans. What they do is not important right now. Just remember that if Spring no longer provides a default user, it’s because you’ve started implementing custom security yourself.</p>

<p><strong>3) It enables CSRF protection.</strong> CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. This CSRF protection applies specifically to state-changing HTTP requests. This means that when a user tries to send a POST (creating new resources), PUT (updating existing resources), DELETE (removing resources) or PATCH (partially updating resources) request, Spring will not allow the request unless the correct CSRF token is also sent along with the request. This is to prevent malicious actors from impersonating others online, which is what Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks aim to do. Don't dwell too much on CSRF for now. Just know that it exists and that Spring Security by default protects against it.</p>

<p><strong>4) It enables form login.</strong> When an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected resource in the application, Spring Security will redirect them to a default login page that contains an HTML form where the user is prompted to enter their username and password. Upon successful login, Spring creates a session for the user, grants access to the requested resource, and redirects the user back to that resource they were trying to access before the login.
<br>If the credentials are incorrect, Spring will display an error message (usually "Bad credentials") and present the login page again.
<br>By default, the login page is served at the <code>/login</code> endpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Spring is highly customizable. For example, we can configure where Spring redirects the user after a successful login, or specify a different page to redirect to if the login fails. Additionally, we can change the default login page from <code>/login</code> to any custom URL. Essentially, Spring allows us to modify almost every aspect of the security flow to suit our needs.</p>

<p><strong>5) It enables password encoding.</strong> Spring creates a default user with username "user" and a random password. Spring will first encode this password and it's only this encoded version of the password that will be shown in the console. It's good practice to never show passwords without encoding them. So Spring Security enables this by default. The default encryption method used by Spring is BCrypt encoding. Don't worry about BCrypt for now, just know that it's the default encryption method.</p>
<h3>Configuring authentication and authorization.</h3>
<p>Security comes down to authentication and authorization.</p>

<p><strong>Authentication</strong> means answering the question: Is the user who he says he is? And this is usually handled through the verification of a username/password combination.</p>

<p><strong>Authorization</strong> means answering the question: What is the user allowed to do or have access to in our application?</p>
<h3>A Configuration class.</h3>
<p>To configure these security aspects in our Spring application, we need a class that is annotated with two annotations, namely <code>@Configuration</code> and <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>@Configuration</code> annotation tells Spring to treat the class as a source of bean definitions, indicating that the class will be used to configure the application. As a result, Spring processes the class during startup to register and manage the beans defined within it.<br>
We could replace <code>@Configuration</code> with <code>@Component</code>, since both annotations ensure that Spring manages the class and any <code>@Bean</code>-annotated methods, creating beans during application startup. But it's best practice to use the most precise annotation 
for the intended purpose. And <code>@Configuration</code> is a more precise annotation for a class that is used to configure our application than <code>@Component</code>. 
And while this goes beyond the scope of this article, I mention it for completeness: both these annotations share similarities, but they are not the same thing. A class annotated with <code>@Configuration</code> will create singleton beans, whereas a class annotated 
with <code>@Component</code> will create a new instance of the bean every time the <code>@Bean</code>-annotated method is called.</p>

<p>The <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code> annotation tells Spring that we are providing a custom security configuration and may want to override the default security 
behavior (like default form login, default user, password encoding, etc.). However <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code> is not strictly required in a Spring Boot application.
Spring Boot automatically enables Spring Security with its default settings when you add the <code>spring-boot-starter-security</code> dependency. If we want to 
customize these default settings, we can do so by defining the necessary configuration beans, such as <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> or <code>UserDetailsService</code>. 
So, we don't need the <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code> annotation to add Spring Security to our Spring Boot application, nor to change the defaults. 
(Don't worry about <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> or <code>UserDetailsService</code> for now. They will be explained later.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we are building a Spring application (so not a Spring Boot application, but a Spring application), <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code> is necessary 
to activate Spring Security. This is because in a Spring application there is less "magic" that does things for us behind the scenes than in a Spring Boot application. And 
in that case, we explicitly need to  tell our framework that it needs to enable Security.<br>
Therefore, the class that handles the security configuration is usually annotated with both <code>@Configuration</code> and <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code>.</p>

<p>Now that we have annotated a class with <code>@Configuration</code> and <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code>, we are ready to start handling the security aspects ourselves. 
This is now our barebones configuration class. I named it ProjectConfig, but you can name it differently. All that matters are the annotations on the class.</p>
<pre><code>
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class ProjectConfig {

}
</code>
</pre>
<p>In Spring Security, the default behavior is to protect all endpoints by requiring authentication. It was a deliberate decision by the Spring developers to opt for this behavior. They 
could also have done the opposite and granted access to all endpoints by default, only securing those that explicitly needed to be secured. However, this would be the less safe option. It's 
better to secure everything by default and then open up only what needs to be accessible, rather than the other way around.</p>

<p>Since Spring is highly customizable, as a developer, you could still take the opposite approach, opening everything up and closing only those endpoints you want to keep restricted. However, I 
would advise you to follow the philosophy of the framework you're working with. You'll have an easier time and a more enjoyable experience that way. And it's simply the safer option.</p>
<h3>Authorization.</h3>
<h3>The SecurityFilterChain.</h3>
<p>Let's first talk about authorization, and later we'll handle authentication.

The object that is responsible for handling authorization in a Spring application is the <code>SecurityFilterChain</code>.
Here's a code example of a <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> declared in our configuration class.</p>
<pre><code>
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class ProjectConfig {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> 
            auth.requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .requestMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")
                .requestMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
        );
        return http.build();
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>The <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> bean takes an <code>HttpSecurity</code> object as its parameter.<code>HttpSecurity</code> is an object that allows us to configure 
web-based security for HTTP requests. And since any interaction between our users and our application will be done in the form of an HTTP request, it's an important part 
of our application.</p>
<p>To handle authorization, we use the <code>authorizeHttpRequests</code> method of <code>HttpSecurity</code>. This method sets up the framework to enforce security rules 
on incoming HTTP requests, allowing us to control access based on conditions like user roles, authentication status, and other factors.</p>
<p>Inside this <code>authorizeHttpRequests</code> method, we provide a lambda function that takes an <code>AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry</code> as a parameter. 
In the code above, we have given that <code>AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry</code> the name <code>auth</code>. It's what gives us access to methods that 
define detailed authorization rules, such as matching specific URL patterns, enforcing role-based or authority-based access, and determining whether requests should be 
allowed, denied, or require authentication.</p>
<p>So, to quickly recapitulate: the <code>authorizeHttpRequests</code> method of <code>HttpSecurity</code> is where authorization rules are set. And the <code>AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry</code> is the object we use within this method to actually specify and configure these rules.</p>
<p>Here are some of the methods of <code>AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry</code>:</p>
<pre>

  <div style="width: 50%;"><code>denyAll()</code></div>
  <div style="width: 50%;">Denies access to the specified request.</div>
</div>
</pre>
<p>Let's go over the code example line by line to demonstrate what's going on:</p>
<pre><code>
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class ProjectConfig {

     @Bean
<strong>1)</strong>   public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {	
<strong>2)</strong>       http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> 							
<strong>3)</strong>           auth.requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")					
<strong>4)</strong>               .requestMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")					
<strong>5)</strong>               .requestMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()					
<strong>6)</strong>               .anyRequest().authenticated()							
        );
<strong>7)</strong>       return http.build();									
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p><strong>1)</strong> The method <code>securityFilterChain</code> is declared as a Spring Bean using <code>@Bean</code>, meaning Spring will manage and instantiate the object returned by the method as part of the application context. The method returns an object of type <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> and this bean is responsible for defining security configurations for the application.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> The <code>authorizeHttpRequests()</code> method is called on the <code>HttpSecurity</code> object, allowing us to configure request authorization rules. In this method we use a lambda expression <code>auth -></code> where <code>auth</code> is the name we gave to the <code>AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry</code>.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> We call the <code>requestMatchers</code> and <code>hasRole</code> methods of the <code>AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry</code> to define specific access rules for different URL patterns. This line specifies that any request matching the /admin/** pattern (e.g., /admin/dashboard, /admin/settings) can only be accessed by users who have the ADMIN role.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Any request matching the /user/** pattern (e.g., /user/profile, /user/settings) requires the USER role to access.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> This line allows unrestricted access to any request matching /public/**. This means that anyone, whether authenticated or not, can access endpoints that start with <code>/public</code></p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> This line ensures that any other request (not explicitly mentioned in the previous matchers) must be authenticated.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> The <code>http.build()</code> call finalizes the <code>HttpSecurity</code> configuration and returns a <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> object, which Spring Security uses to enforce the security rules in the application.</p>
<p>The API for <code>HttpSecurity</code> can be found at: <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/api/java/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/web/builders/HttpSecurity.html" target="_blank"><code>HttpSecurity API</code></a> along with examples of its use.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next part goes beyond the scope of this article. If you really want to dive into the details of the above code, then continue reading, but know that this next section is completely unnecessary to get the most out of this article. In fact, it might make it even harder to understand the main points because it could distract and confuse you. 
This part is just me nerding out and wanting to explore the details. You can skip this section without any issues. I've marked where the main article resumes with "For those who want to get on with things, continue reading here" in bold text, so feel free to jump straight to that part.</p>
<p>This is the actual method signature of <code>authorizeHttpRequests</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
public HttpSecurity authorizeHttpRequests(
    Customizer&lt;AuthorizeHttpRequestsConfigurer&lt;HttpSecurity&gt;.AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry&gt; authorizeHttpRequestsCustomizer
)
</code>
</pre>
<p>As we can see the method takes a <code>Customizer</code> as it's parameter. So, what's a <code>Customizer</code>? A <code>Customizer</code> is just a functional interface that is often used in Spring Security for configuration purposes.
Here is it's signature:</p>
<pre><code>
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Customizer<T> {
    void customize(T t);
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>So, this functional interface takes an object and doesn't return anything. Customizers are used all over Spring Security because they make configurations more readable, maintainable, and keep the configuration context (in this case, the <code>auth</code> parameter) scoped to just where it's needed. This makes the code more maintainable and less prone to errors.
Take this code for instance:</p>
<pre><code>
http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> {
      auth.requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
        .requestMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")
        .anyRequest().authenticated();
});
</code>	
</pre>
<p>It does the exact same thing, but is a lot less verbose than this code:</p>
<pre><code>
http.authorizeHttpRequests(new Customizer&lt;AuthorizeHttpRequestsConfigurer&lt;HttpSecurity&gt;.AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry&gt;() {
    @Override
    public void customize(AuthorizeHttpRequestsConfigurer&lt;HttpSecurity&gt;.AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry auth) {
        auth.requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .requestMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")
            .anyRequest().authenticated();
    }
});
</code>
</pre>
<p>The class we use in the <code>Customizer</code> is <code>AuthorizeHttpRequestsConfigurer&lt;T&gt;</code>. This is a generic class where T is the type parameter.
In this case the type is <code>HttpSecurity</code>, which means that this <code>AuthorizeHttpRequestsConfigurer</code> class is configured to work with <code>HttpSecurity</code>.</p>
<p>And this configuration class has an inner class of type <code>AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry</code>. This inner class maintains the registry 
of request matchers and their corresponding authorization rules. Or in other words, <code>AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry</code> is responsible for keeping track of which HTTP
requests should be protected and what security rules apply to them.</p>
<p>So, what we are actually doing in the <code>authorizeHttpRequests</code> method, is use a <code>Customizer</code> to allow us to use 
the methods of that inner class <code>AuthorizationManagerRequestMatcherRegistry</code> within a lambda function.</p>
<p><strong>For those who want to get on with things, continue reading here:</strong></p>
<p>Note that the matchers are considered in order. Therefore, the following code will not do what we want it to do.</p> 

<pre><code>
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class AuthorizeUrlsSecurityConfig {
        
   @Bean
   public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
           http
               .authorizeHttpRequests()
                   .requestMatchers("/**").hasRole("USER")
                   .requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN");
           return http.build();
   }
</code>
</pre>
<p>The first matcher matches every request and therefore will prevent the second matcher from doing its work. A normal user who does not have administrator credentials will still get access to our <code>/admin</code> endpoint based on the first matcher that gives access to all endpoints starting with "/" <code>.requestMatcher("/**").hasRole("USER")</code>. And therefore, the second matcher <code>.requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")</code> that is supposed to prevent this access, will not be effective.</p>
<p>Swapping the matchers, so the <code>.requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")</code> comes first, solves the problem.</p>

<p>When we define a <code>SecurityFilterChain</code>, we are overwriting the defaults. This has some consequences. For instance, Spring no longer presents the user with a login form when he is not authenticated and is trying to access an endpoint that requires authentication. Take for instance this <code>SecurityFilterChain</code>:</p>

<pre><code>
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
            .requestMatchers("/private").authenticated()
            .anyRequest().permitAll()
        );
    return http.build();
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>All requests are permitted (no need to be authenticated) except the <code>/private</code> endpoint which requires authentication. The default Spring Security behavior is to present users with a login page for those endpoints that require authentication. But since we have overwritten this default behavior by using our own <code>SecurityFilterChain</code>, a user that is not logged in will no longer be presented with a login form when they try to visit our <code>/private</code> endpoint. What they will see instead is a generic error page informing them of a Forbidden Error with error code 403.</p> 
<p>If we want to present our user with a login form for endpoints that require authentication, we now need to explicitly tell Spring that we want to do so. By adding <code>.formLogin(Customizer.withDefaults())</code> to our <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> we tell Spring to present unauthenticated users with a login form whenever they attempt to access any protected resources (i.e., endpoints that require authentication). We could customize this login procedure, but I chose to use the default implementation of Spring's form-based authentication, which is indicated by <code>Customizer.withDefaults()</code>. A code example:</p>
<pre><code>
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
            .requestMatchers("/private").authenticated()
            .anyRequest().permitAll()
        )
        .formLogin(Customizer.withDefaults());
    return http.build();
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>By explicitly adding <code>formLogin()</code>, we have re-enabled form-based authentication. Our user will be presented with a default login page configured by Spring at <code>/login</code>.</p>

<h3>Authentication.</h3>
<h3>UserDetailsService and UserDetails.</h3>
<p>Since we presented the user with a login page, Spring will also receive a username and password when the user fills out the form and submits it. It then needs to verify these credentials.

To do this, Spring must know where to retrieve the necessary information to be able to handle this verification. Should it check a database, look in memory, or search the cache?
Or does this information come from external authentication providers (OAuth2, LDAP), configuration files or environment variables (not recommended for production), API's or web services? </p>
<p>Spring expects us to provide it with a <code>UserDetailsService</code> to help it find this information.</p>

<p>A <code>UserDetailsService</code> is nothing more than an interface that has one method: <code>loadUserByUsername(String username)</code>. This method does nothing but 
go to the place where it can find the information regarding our users, fetch the information about the current user based on the provided username and return this in the 
form of a <code>UserDetails</code> object.</p>

<p>A <code>UserDetails</code> object is an object that implements the <code>UserDetails</code> interface. Spring uses this interface to authenticate users. This object has 
to implement the following methods: <code>getUsername()</code>, <code>getPassword()</code>, <code>getAuthorities()</code>, <code>isAccountNonExpired()</code>, <code>isAccountNonLocked()</code>, 
<code>isCredentialsNonExpired()</code>, <code>isEnabled()</code>. These are all methods that answer the question of whether a user exists in our system, has the correct 
credentials, and if their account is still valid.</p>

<p>This might seem a bit complicated, but it is actually quite straightforward. When a user tries to access our application, Spring needs to verify their identity. To do 
so, Spring expects to receive the user’s information in a standardized format. Something it can easily understand and work with. That standardized format is the 
<code>UserDetails</code> object. Think of it as a well-organized report about the user, containing their username, password, and roles.</p>

<p>By providing Spring with a <code>UserDetails</code> object, we're giving it the necessary information to authenticate the user. Spring can then compare the credentials provided during login with the stored details and decide whether to grant access.</p>

<p>And to pass this information to Spring, we need a component that knows where to find user data and how to convert it into a <code>UserDetails</code> object. That’s exactly the role of the <code>UserDetailsService</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Spring Security provides a <code>User</code> class, which provides a convenient way to create a <code>UserDetails</code> object as it implements
the UserDetails interface. In this class we only need to provide a username, a password and a collection of roles (can also be a collection that contains just one role). 
All other fields in the <code>User</code> class are automatically set when these values are provided. The API for this class can be found at: 
<a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/api/java/org/springframework/security/core/userdetails/User.html" target="_blank"><code>Spring Security User 
API</code></a>.</p>
<p>Here is a bean that implements the <code>UserDetailsService</code> and makes use of this convenient <code>User</code> class. It has only one method that takes in a 
String and returns a <code>UserDetails</code> object:</p>

<pre><code>
@Bean
public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
    return username -> User.withUsername("username")
                           .password("{noop}password")
                           .roles("USER")
                           .build();
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This current implementation serves only as an example. It will always return the same <code>UserDetails</code> object, with "username" as its username and inform 
Spring that the password is not encrypted (<code>{noop}</code> = no encryption) and is "password". If a user would try to login with the credentials 
<code>username/password</code>, then this implementation would allow that user to be authenticated. However, in a real production environment, our <code>UserDetailsService</code> 
would return different usernames and actual encrypted passwords that are connected to those usernames.</p>

<p>Here is another example, it provides a quick way to test different roles and authentication without the hassle of setting up a database connection, as user information 
is stored in memory. We define two roles: a regular user and an administrator.</p>

<pre><code>
@Bean
public UserDetailsService users() {
    UserDetails user = User.builder() 
        .username("user")
        .password("{noop}user")
        .roles("USER")
        .build();
    UserDetails admin = User.builder()
        .username("admin")
        .password("{noop}admin")
        .roles("USER", "ADMIN")
        .build();
    return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(user, admin);
}
</code>
</pre>
<h3>PasswordEncoder.</h3>
<p>Since all passwords should be encrypted, we need to tell Spring how we would like to handle this encryption in our application. To do this, we need to give Spring a bean of type <code>PasswordEncoder</code>. This is an interface that allows Spring to encrypt passwords and to compare a non-encrypted password provided by the user to its encrypted counterpart provided by <code>UserDetails</code>.</p>

<p>Here's an example of such a bean that returns a <code>PasswordEncoder</code>, which is in this case a <code>BCryptPasswordEncoder</code>. We can use a lot of different encryption methods in Spring. <code>BCryptPasswordEncoder</code> is a method that is commonly used. If we would like to use a different method, we can just change the return value of our <code>PasswordEncoder</code> bean:</p>

<pre><code>
@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Spring Security 5 introduced the <code>DelegatingPasswordEncoder</code> as its default encoder. It's a multifunctional encoder that automatically detects the correct encoding based on the stored password's prefix and can handle all those different encodings.</p>

<pre><code>
@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return PasswordEncoderFactories.createDelegatingPasswordEncoder();
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Here are examples of passwords encoded with different algorithms and their respective prefixes using Spring Security's <code>PasswordEncoder</code>.</p>
<pre>

</div>
<div style="display: flex; line-height: 1;">
  <div style="width: 20%;">{argon2}</div>
  <div style="width: 30%;">Argon2</div>
  <div style="width: 50%;">{argon2}$argon2i$v=19$m=1024,t=2,p=1$Y2F2...</div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; line-height: 1;">
  <div style="width: 20%;">{pbkdf2}</div>
  <div style="width: 30%;">PBKDF2</div>
  <div style="width: 50%;">{pbkdf2}sha256$100000$7d935e4f8b04...</div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; line-height: 1;">
  <div style="width: 20%;">{noop}</div>
  <div style="width: 30%;">No Encoding</div>
  <div style="width: 50%;">{noop}password123</div>
</div>
</pre>
<p>The <code>DelegatingPasswordEncoder</code> will read the prefix, such as {pbkdf2}, and determine the appropriate password encoding to use based on the prefix.</p>

<p>Spring Security authenticates a user by following these steps:<br>
<strong>Retrieve user details.</strong> It fetches the username and encrypted password from the <code>UserDetails</code> object provided by the <code>UserDetailsService</code>.<br>

<strong>Encrypt the input password.</strong> It takes the password entered by the user in the login form and encrypts it using the same password encoder that was used to store the original password.<br>

<strong>Compare passwords.</strong> It checks if the encrypted version of the input password matches the stored password from the <code>UserDetails</code> object.<br>

<strong>Grant or deny access.</strong> If the passwords match, the user is successfully authenticated; otherwise, authentication fails.</p>

<p>With the <code>PasswordEncoder</code>, we've now covered all the basic elements needed to set up Spring Security. So, time to recapitulate: there are five requirements for Spring Security to work in our application:<br>
- The Spring Security dependency (<code>spring-boot-starter-security</code> for Spring Boot applications).<br>
- A configuration class annotated with <code>@Configuration</code> and <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code>.<br>
- A <code>SecurityFilterChain</code>.<br>
- A <code>UserDetailsService</code>.<br>
- A <code>PasswordEncoder</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is actually only one requirement for Security to work in a Spring Boot application, not five—the <code>spring-boot-starter-security</code> dependency. With this dependency alone, Spring Security will be enabled with default settings. But these defaults are often impractical for real-world applications.</p>

<p>To customize the security configuration, only a <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> is required. As long as this <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> is defined in a component-scanned class, Spring Boot will handle the rest. Therefore, a class annotated with <code>@Configuration</code> and <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code> is not strictly necessary in a Spring Boot application.</p>

<p>However, if we are using Spring (without Spring Boot), then <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code> is required to activate Spring Security. Additionally, while the <code>@Configuration</code> annotation is not mandatory, it is considered best practice when defining configuration classes.</p>

<p>If we want to allow more users than just the default one generated by Spring Security, a <code>UserDetailsService</code> becomes necessary. This Service is responsible for verifying users by retrieving the user information we have stored. It constructs a <code>UserDetails</code> object based on the stored data and provides it to Spring Security for authentication.</p>

<p>A <code>PasswordEncoder</code> is not strictly required for Spring Security to function. We could store passwords in plain text, though doing so would be highly insecure. If we are going to ignore password encryption, why bother using Spring Security at all?</p>

<p>So, while the only real minimum requirement is the security dependency, we typically say there are five key elements to ensure real-world usability of Spring Security.</p>
<h3>Conclusion.</h3>
<p>In summary, these five building blocks form the foundation of Spring Security’s authentication and authorization process.
The <code>spring-boot-starter-security</code> dependency activates security features by default, restricting access to endpoints.
A configuration class, usually annotated with <code>@Configuration</code> and <code>@EnableWebSecurity</code> defines and customizes security settings.
The <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> dictates how requests are secured, determining which endpoints require authentication and what roles users need.
The <code>UserDetailsService</code> retrieves user information from a database or other storage and transforms it into a <code>UserDetails</code> object that Spring Security can process.
Finally, the <code>PasswordEncoder</code> ensures passwords are securely hashed and compared during authentication.
Together, these components enable a flexible and robust security system.</p>
<p>I hope this article has given you a clear picture of the core building blocks of Spring Security and how they fit together. With this foundation, you should now be well-prepared to dive deeper into the world of Spring Security and explore it's finer details.</p>
